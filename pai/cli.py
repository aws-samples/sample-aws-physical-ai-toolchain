"""pai CLI — root command group and subcommand registration.

Entry point: main() (wired in pyproject.toml as `pai = "pai.cli:main"`).

Command registration contract:
    Each pai/commands/*.py module must expose a register(cli: click.Group) function.
    The registration is wrapped in try/except ImportError so the CLI group loads
    even if a command module is not yet implemented.

Keep `pai --help` fast: no torch/isaacsim imports at module top. Subcommands
import heavy modules inside their function bodies (lazy-import).

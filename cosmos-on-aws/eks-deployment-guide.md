# Cosmos 3 on EKS — Deployment Guide

Run Cosmos3-Super V2V generation as a **self-contained Kubernetes Job** on a dedicated Amazon EKS cluster. **Validated end-to-end**, including fully automatic GPU node scaling — a real UR3 clip generated a synthetic video after Cluster Autoscaler brought up a GPU node group launched into an EC2 Capacity Block, and the pod handled the whole pipeline internally (start server → wait ready → pull reference video from S3 → generate → push result to S3 → exit) before Cluster Autoscaler scaled the node back down automatically. Output matched the EC2 path.

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the overview and the EC2-vs-EKS comparison.

---

## Why EKS (vs EC2)

- **Multiple concurrent generation jobs.** Run several Cosmos3-Super replicas in parallel across a GPU node pool instead of one instance handling requests serially.
- **Fits a continuous flywheel.** If generation becomes an ongoing pipeline (not a one-off experiment), Kubernetes gives you scheduling, retries, and scaling primitives EC2 doesn't.
- **Integrates with a broader orchestration layer.** If your training/simulation pipeline already runs on EKS (see [OSMO](../osmo-on-aws/)), running Cosmos 3 generation as Kubernetes Jobs keeps everything in one control plane.

Use the [EC2 guide](ec2-deployment-guide.md) instead if you're experimenting, running a single workshop session, or don't need more than one generation job at a time.

**Current scope:** this guide covers a single GPU node running one Cosmos3-Super replica — the same 8-GPU-per-replica model validated on EC2, just orchestrated by Kubernetes instead of a raw EC2 instance. Multi-replica scaling and shared FSx storage are documented as [Future Work](#future-work-multi-replica--shared-storage) — they add real cost/complexity that only pays off once you need concurrent generation jobs.

```

The pod does everything itself: it reads the reference clip directly from S3 and
writes the generated video (plus a copy of the reference) directly back to S3
using its own IRSA credentials. The only place a file touches local disk is the
pod's own `emptyDir` scratch volume, which is required for the HTTP multipart
upload/download to the local server — there's no local file on your machine and
no external client driving the generation call.

---

## Prerequisites

Same as the [EC2 guide's prerequisites](ec2-deployment-guide.md#prerequisites) — Foundation deployed, an active P5 Capacity Block, HuggingFace token with both gated licenses accepted, stored in Secrets Manager. Additionally:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `kubectl` installed | Manage the cluster |
| AWS provider `< 6.0.0` pinned | The `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws` module requires it — `terraform init -upgrade` handles this automatically |

---

## Step 1: Reserve a Capacity Block

Same as [EC2 guide Step 1](ec2-deployment-guide.md#step-1-reserve-a-capacity-block). Note the AZ — the GPU node group is pinned to it (see Step 2).

> **p5.48xlarge Capacity Blocks are 24-hour minimum.** If none are available at that duration, check for shorter/nearer-term offerings across durations — availability and pricing vary significantly by start time.

---

## Step 2: Deploy the EKS Cluster

The cluster is defined in [`infra/eks.tf`](infra/eks.tf), gated behind `enable_eks_cluster` (default `false`) — safe to leave in any `terraform apply` since it adds zero resources when disabled. **Once created, the control plane bills continuously (~$0.10/hr) until destroyed**, independent of GPU node scaling.

```bash
cd cosmos-on-aws/infra
terraform init -upgrade   # pulls the eks module + downgrades the AWS provider to <6.0.0
terraform apply \
  -var="aws_region=<REGION>" \
  -var="enable_eks_cluster=true"
```

This creates:
- The EKS control plane + OIDC provider
- A `system` node group (`t3.medium`, always on — runs CoreDNS/addons)
- A `gpu` node group (`p5.48xlarge`, **`desired_size=0` by default** — no GPU cost while idle)
- Addons: CoreDNS, kube-proxy, VPC CNI, EBS CSI driver
- **Cluster Autoscaler** (Helm release) — automatically scales the GPU node group 0→1 when a Job needs it and back to 0 when idle. See [Step 4](#step-4-how-autoscaling-works-no-manual-steps-needed).
- IRSA role for a `cosmos3-generator` service account (S3 write to the datasets bucket, Secrets Manager read for the HF token)

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name $(terraform output -raw eks_cluster_name) --region <REGION>
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see one `t3.medium` node, `Ready`.

### Install the NVIDIA device plugin (one-time, cluster-wide)

The GPU node's AMI (`AL2_x86_64_GPU`) has drivers baked in, but Kubernetes still needs the device plugin to expose GPUs as an allocatable resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.17.0/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
```

This runs as a daemonset with a built-in toleration for the GPU taint, so it schedules automatically once a GPU node joins.

---

## Step 3: Create the ServiceAccount

The IRSA role was created by Terraform in Step 2; bind it to a Kubernetes ServiceAccount:

```bash
IRSA_ARN=$(cd cosmos-on-aws/infra && terraform output -raw eks_pod_irsa_role_arn)

kubectl create serviceaccount cosmos3-generator -n default --dry-run=client -o yaml | \
  kubectl annotate -f - --local -o yaml eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn="$IRSA_ARN" | \
  kubectl apply -f -
```

Create the HF token secret in the cluster:

```bash
HF_TOKEN=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id physical-ai/hf-token \
  --region <REGION> --query 'SecretString' --output text)
kubectl create secret generic hf-token -n default --from-literal=token="$HF_TOKEN" \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

---

## Step 4: How Autoscaling Works (No Manual Steps Needed)

**Validated end-to-end.** Cluster Autoscaler is deployed by Terraform in Step 2 and handles GPU node scaling automatically — you don't need to run `aws eks update-nodegroup-config` at all in normal operation:

- **Scale up:** when you `kubectl apply` the Job (Step 5) and its pod can't schedule (no GPU node exists), Cluster Autoscaler detects the pending pod within ~1 min, matches its `nvidia.com/gpu: 8` request against the GPU node group's node-template tags, and scales the ASG from 0→1.
- **Scale down:** once you delete the Job (Step 8) and the GPU node sits idle past `scale-down-unneeded-time` (10 min, configured in `eks.tf`), Cluster Autoscaler removes the node automatically — no action needed.

**Validated timings:** pending pod → ASG desired=1 in ~44s; idle node → scaled back to 0 in ~14 min after Job deletion.

This works because the GPU node group carries `k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/*` tags on its ASG (set in `eks.tf`) that tell Cluster Autoscaler what a *not-yet-existing* node would offer — its GPU count, labels, and taints — so it can evaluate whether a pending pod would fit before actually launching anything. Without these tags, autoscaler can't reason about a node group sitting at 0 instances and will never scale it up.

### First-time / Capacity Block setup

Autoscaling only works once the GPU node group's launch template is correctly targeting an active Capacity Block. Set this via Terraform:

```bash
terraform apply \
  -var="aws_region=<REGION>" -var="enable_eks_cluster=true" \
  -var="eks_gpu_capacity_reservation_id=<CR_ID>" \
  -var="eks_gpu_availability_zone=<AZ>"
```

**Switching to a new Capacity Block after the previous one expires:** re-run the same command with the new `eks_gpu_capacity_reservation_id`. This updates the launch template in place (no node group replacement) as long as the AZ hasn't changed. If the GPU node group has a running instance at the time (`capacity_type=CAPACITY_BLOCK`), the update will fail — scale it to 0 first:
```bash
aws eks update-nodegroup-config --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --nodegroup-name <GPU_NODEGROUP_NAME> \
  --scaling-config minSize=0,maxSize=1,desiredSize=0 \
  --region <REGION>
# wait for the instance to terminate (can take several minutes for p5.48xlarge), then re-apply
```

### If you ever need to scale manually (bypassing the autoscaler)

For debugging or to pre-warm a node before a Job, you can still scale directly:
```bash
aws eks update-nodegroup-config --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --nodegroup-name <GPU_NODEGROUP_NAME> \
  --scaling-config minSize=0,maxSize=1,desiredSize=1 \
  --region <REGION>
```
Get the exact node group name (EKS appends a random suffix): `aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> --region <REGION>`.

Confirm 8 GPUs are exposed once the node is `Ready`:
```bash
kubectl get node <GPU_NODE_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity.nvidia\.com/gpu}'
```

### Terraform gotchas hit during validation (already fixed in `eks.tf`, documented for context)

1. **AZ mismatch.** EKS node groups by default span all private subnets across AZs. A Capacity Block is reserved in exactly one AZ — if the node group launches in a different AZ than the reservation, EC2 rejects it: `Capacity Reservation's attribute does not match with requested instance parameter. Attribute: AvailabilityZone`. Fix: `eks.tf` pins the GPU node group's `subnet_ids` to a single AZ-filtered subnet via `eks_gpu_availability_zone`.
2. **Missing `instance_market_options`.** `capacity_reservation_specification` alone is not sufficient for Capacity Block launches — the launch template also needs `instance_market_options { market_type = "capacity-block" }`, or the API rejects the node group with `market type (purchasing) option is not valid`. Fix: `eks.tf` sets both together whenever a Capacity Block ID is provided.
3. **Updating a `CAPACITY_BLOCK` node group while it has a running instance fails.** `AutoScalingGroupInvalidConfiguration: Upgrade of the node group is not allowed when the current capacity of the Auto Scaling group is not zero and the capacity type is set to CAPACITY_BLOCK.` Scale to 0 and wait for termination before changing the launch template (e.g. pointing at a new Capacity Block ID).
4. **Autoscaler can't scale a zero-node group without node-template tags.** Without `k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/resources/nvidia.com/gpu` (and the label/taint equivalents) on the ASG, Cluster Autoscaler has no way to know what a not-yet-launched node offers, and silently never scales up. Fix: `eks.tf` sets these tags directly on the GPU node group.

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Self-Contained Cosmos3 Job

The Job manifest (`cosmos-on-aws/cosmos3-job.yaml`) runs the same server configuration validated on EC2 — `vllm/vllm-omni:cosmos3` serving `nvidia/Cosmos3-Super` with `--cfg-parallel-size 2 --ulysses-degree 4 --use-hsdp --hsdp-shard-size 8` — but unlike an earlier version of this guide, the pod is **fully self-contained**. There's no `Service`, no `kubectl port-forward`, and no external `curl` call. The container's own entrypoint script:

1. Installs the AWS CLI (`pip3 install awscli` — the image has no `unzip`, so the official zip installer doesn't work)
2. Starts `vllm serve` in the background
3. Polls `http://localhost:8000/v1/models` until the server reports ready
4. Downloads the reference video from S3 (`INPUT_S3_URI`) straight into its `emptyDir` scratch volume, using the pod's own IRSA credentials
5. `POST`s to its own `localhost:8000/v1/videos/sync` to generate the V2V output
6. Uploads the result and a copy of the reference to S3 (`OUTPUT_S3_PREFIX`)
7. Exits — the Job reports `Completed`

Configure the run via the env vars in the manifest (`INPUT_S3_URI`, `OUTPUT_S3_PREFIX`, `OUTPUT_FILENAME`, `REFERENCE_FILENAME`, `PROMPT`, `SEED`) instead of running commands by hand.

```bash
cd cosmos-on-aws
kubectl apply -f cosmos3-job.yaml
```

Watch the pod schedule onto the GPU node and follow the whole pipeline in its logs:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=cosmos3-vllm-omni -o wide
kubectl logs -l app=cosmos3-vllm-omni -f
```

**Model weight download is ~126 GB from HuggingFace** — same as EC2, takes 15-20 min on first pull since the `emptyDir` cache doesn't persist across pod restarts. Model load itself (weights → GPU, HSDP sharding, torch.compile) adds another few minutes once the download completes.

The Job has `activeDeadlineSeconds: 2700` (45 min), enough for a first-time model download + load (~15-20 min) + generation (~2-8 min) + upload with headroom. Once the model is warm on a still-running node, a rerun of the Job would only need the generation + upload portion — but note the `emptyDir` cache doesn't survive pod deletion, so a brand-new pod always re-downloads.

> **Avoid `kubectl exec -it` in non-interactive/scripted environments** (CI, automation, or a tool-driven session without a real TTY) — it panics with a Go runtime nil-pointer crash trying to manage terminal resize. `kubectl logs -f` (used above) doesn't need a TTY and is sufficient to follow this Job's progress.

---

## Step 6: Confirm It Finished and Check the Output in S3

Wait for the Job to report success:
```bash
kubectl get jobs cosmos3-vllm-omni
```
Look for `COMPLETIONS: 1/1`. `kubectl describe job cosmos3-vllm-omni` shows `1 Succeeded` under Pods Statuses once done, and the pod's own logs (still visible via `kubectl logs <pod-name>` even after it exits) end with the upload confirmations followed by `Job complete.`

**Validated result:** pod ran the full pipeline unattended — server ready → reference video downloaded from S3 → V2V generated → both output and reference uploaded to S3 → clean exit, `Job` `Completed`.

Confirm the two new objects landed in S3 (filenames come from `OUTPUT_FILENAME`/`REFERENCE_FILENAME` in the manifest):
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<DATASETS_BUCKET>/cosmos-samples/ --region <REGION> --human-readable
```

---

## Step 7: Validate the Output

Pull the generated file down locally just to run `ffprobe` against it — this is a one-off validation step, not part of the pipeline itself:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://<DATASETS_BUCKET>/cosmos-samples/augmented_episode_000000_eks_selfcontained.mp4 . --region <REGION>
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration,size -show_entries stream=width,height,codec_name \
  augmented_episode_000000_eks_selfcontained.mp4
```

Expect `width=1280`, `height=720`, `codec_name=h264`, `duration≈7.875` (189 frames at 24fps). **Validated exactly this on the self-contained EKS Job path** — matches the EC2 path's output.

Same validation approach as [EC2 Step 4b](ec2-deployment-guide.md#step-4b-validate-the-output-in-s3), just pulling from a different S3 key.

---

## Step 8: Tear Down

**Delete the Job** when done — since it's `restartPolicy: Never` with `backoffLimit: 0`, the pod already exited on its own after uploading to S3 (Job shows `Completed`). Deleting just cleans up the Job/pod objects; Cluster Autoscaler takes care of scaling the GPU node back to 0 automatically (~10-15 min after the node goes idle, no action needed):
```bash
kubectl delete -f cosmos-on-aws/cosmos3-job.yaml
```

Confirm it scaled down (optional):
```bash
watch -n 30 "aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> --nodegroup-name <GPU_NODEGROUP_NAME> --region <REGION> --query 'nodegroup.scalingConfig.desiredSize'"
```

If you need the GPU node gone immediately (don't want to wait for the idle timer), scale it manually instead:
```bash
aws eks update-nodegroup-config --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
  --nodegroup-name <GPU_NODEGROUP_NAME> \
  --scaling-config minSize=0,maxSize=1,desiredSize=0 \
  --region <REGION>
```

**Delete the entire cluster** when you're done with EKS entirely (stops control-plane billing too):
```bash
cd cosmos-on-aws/infra
terraform destroy -var="aws_region=<REGION>" -var="enable_eks_cluster=true"
```

The Capacity Block itself expires automatically at its end time regardless of node group state.

---

## Cost

| Resource | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| EKS control plane | ~$0.10/hr | Bills continuously once created, independent of node scaling |
| System node (`t3.medium`) | ~$0.04/hr | Always on |
| GPU node (`p5.48xlarge`, Capacity Block) | Same as [EC2 pricing](ec2-deployment-guide.md#cost) | Only while `desired_size=1` |
| Per generation | ~$0 marginal | Same as EC2 — block cost is fixed |

**EKS adds ~$0.14/hr over the EC2 path** for the control plane + system node, whether or not you're generating. Worth it once you need multiple concurrent Jobs; pure overhead for a single one-off generation — use EC2 for that case.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Capacity Reservation's attribute does not match... Attribute: AvailabilityZone` | GPU node group subnets span multiple AZs, Capacity Block is single-AZ | Set `eks_gpu_availability_zone` so the node group only uses that AZ's subnet (already the default behavior in `eks.tf`) |
| `market type (purchasing) option is not valid` | `capacity_reservation_specification` set without `instance_market_options` | Both must be set together — already handled in `eks.tf` when `eks_gpu_capacity_reservation_id` is non-empty |
| `terraform apply` with a new `-var eks_gpu_node_desired_size=1` doesn't scale the node | Module sets `ignore_changes` on `desired_size` (intentional — Cluster Autoscaler owns this after initial creation) | Let Cluster Autoscaler handle it by submitting a Job (Step 5); for manual override use `aws eks update-nodegroup-config` |
| Job's pod stays `Pending` for more than ~2 min with no node appearing | Cluster Autoscaler not running, or missing node-template tags on the ASG | `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-cluster-autoscaler` — confirm it's `Running`; check its logs for `failed to find place for` messages, which confirm it saw the pod. If it's not scaling, verify the GPU node group's ASG has the `k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/*` tags (`eks.tf` sets these) |
| GPU node `Ready` but pod stuck `Pending` | NVIDIA device plugin not installed, or node's GPU capacity not yet advertised | `kubectl apply` the device plugin daemonset; wait ~30s after node `Ready` for capacity to appear |
| GPU node doesn't scale down after deleting the Job | Still within the 10-min `scale-down-unneeded-time` window, or another pod is still using the node | Wait — validated at ~14 min end-to-end from Job deletion to `desiredSize=0`; check `kubectl get pods -A -o wide` for anything still scheduled on the GPU node |
| Pod scheduled but never becomes `Running` / image pull slow | ~30GB `vllm/vllm-omni:cosmos3` pull on first schedule to a fresh node | Normal — same pull time as the EC2 path; check `kubectl describe pod` for pull progress |
| `terraform init` fails with a provider version conflict | EKS module requires AWS provider `< 6.0.0`, lock file has a newer version | `terraform init -upgrade` |
| IAM role name length error on `terraform plan`/`apply` | EKS module appends `-eks-node-group-<suffix>` to node group names; long prefixes exceed IAM's 38-char `name_prefix` limit | Keep node group `name` short (this repo uses `cosmos3-system` / `cosmos3-gpu`, not prefixed with the full stack name) |
| `kubectl exec -it ... -- curl ...` panics with a Go nil-pointer crash | No real TTY available (scripted/automated shell) | Not needed for this Job — everything runs inside the container's entrypoint script. Use `kubectl logs -f <pod-name>` to follow progress instead of `exec -it` |
| GPU node stuck at `NotReady` after joining | Normal for the first ~10-30s while kubelet/CNI initialize | Wait; check `kubectl describe node` if it persists past a minute |
| Entrypoint fails trying to install AWS CLI (`unzip: not found` or similar) | `vllm/vllm-omni:cosmos3` doesn't ship `unzip`, which the official AWS CLI v2 zip installer requires | Already fixed in `cosmos3-job.yaml` — installs via `pip3 install awscli` instead, which is pure-Python and needs no `unzip` |

---

## Future Work: Multi-Replica + Shared Storage

Not needed for a single generation job (what this guide validates), but worth doing if Cosmos 3 becomes a continuous production pipeline:

1. **FSx for Lustre** for shared `HF_HOME` — avoids each new GPU node/pod re-downloading the full ~126GB of model weights. Requires provisioning FSx, mounting it via a PVC instead of `emptyDir`, and IAM for the FSx CSI driver.
2. **Multiple GPU node group replicas** (`max_size > 1`, one Job per replica) for concurrent generation — each replica still needs its own full 8-GPU allocation (Cosmos3-Super's parallelism is within-node, not across nodes), so this is horizontal scaling by replica count, not by making a single generation faster.
3. **Capacity for multiple P5 nodes simultaneously** — either multiple Capacity Blocks or a larger single reservation; `InstanceMatchCriteria=targeted` reservations are for exactly the reserved count.
4. **Request routing across replicas** if exposing a single endpoint for many replicas — standard Kubernetes `Service` load balancing works for stateless HTTP, but each generation call is long-running (minutes) and stateful within a request, so validate behavior under concurrent load before relying on it in production.
